# Split Screen Pro

A Chrome extension that brings Microsoft Edge's split-screen functionality to Chrome browsers.
![img.png](img.png)

## 🎯 Motivation

Microsoft Edge has a fantastic built-in split-screen feature that allows users to view two web pages side by side. Unfortunately, Chrome lacks this native functionality. This extension was created to fill that gap and bring the same convenience to Chrome users.

## ✨ Features

- **Vertical Split**: Split the screen vertically to view two pages side by side
- **Horizontal Split**: Split the screen horizontally for top/bottom layout
- **Interactive Resizer**: Drag the divider to adjust panel sizes
- **Session Sync**: Advanced cookie and session synchronization for seamless browsing
- **Tab Integration**: Quick access to currently open tabs
- **Bookmark Integration**: Easy access to Chrome bookmarks
- **History Support**: Quick navigation to recently visited pages
- **Gmail Optimization**: Special handling for Gmail and Google services

## 🚀 Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder
5. The extension icon will appear in your toolbar

## 📖 Usage

1. Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar
2. Choose your preferred split mode:
- **Vertical Split**: Creates left and right panels
- **Horizontal Split**: Creates top and bottom panels
3. Use the address bar in the split view to navigate to any website
4. Click on tab icons to quickly switch between open tabs
5. Access bookmarks and history from the initial interface
6. Press `ESC` to exit split view mode

## ⚠️ Known Issues

This extension is currently in development and has several known issues that need addressing:

### 🐛 Critical Bugs

1. **Gmail Cookie Issues**: Gmail experiences cookie synchronization problems, affecting login state
2. **Session Sync Failures**: Some applications (Notion, etc.) don't properly sync login sessions between main window and split view
3. **OAuth Callback Problems**: When logging into services within split view, the callback URLs aren't properly handled, causing login failures
4. **Code Complexity**: The codebase has grown large and needs significant refactoring for maintainability

### 🔧 Help Needed

I'm looking for contributors to help resolve these issues, particularly:
- Cookie and session management experts
- Chrome extension API specialists
- JavaScript developers familiar with iframe security policies
- UI/UX developers for interface improvements
